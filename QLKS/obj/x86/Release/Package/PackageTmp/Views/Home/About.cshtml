    <p style="font-size:20px;">As the summer sun continues to beat down on London, it's been hard for us to keep our minds on our work and away from our upcoming beach holidays. As such, we've decided to put together a list of the 10 most beautiful hotels we've come across while dreaming of idyllic getaways. From the stunning Poseidon Undersea Resorts in Fiji to the icy cool Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway, the list takes us all over the world, showcasing the finest places the highly competitive billion dollar hotel industry has to offer.
